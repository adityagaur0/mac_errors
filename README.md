The .zshrc file is not present by default in macOS Catalina, we need to create it.

Steps for creation:

Open Terminal
Type touch ~/.zshrc to create the respective file. (touch command will create the .zshrc in your current directory but it will be hidden)
Hit Return
To view/open ~/.zshrc you can do either of two things:

Open Finder > Press Cmd+Shift+.
Or:

Open Terminal > and type: open ~/.zshrc


```
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin
```
